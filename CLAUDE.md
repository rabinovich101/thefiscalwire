1. Think and Plan: First, slow down and think through the entire problem. Read the codebase for relevant files and write a detailed plan to a todo.md file.
2. Create a Checklist: The plan must contain a list of to-do items that can be checked off as they are completed.
3. Verify the Plan: Before starting work, check in with the user to verify and approve the plan.
4. Execute Step-by-Step: Begin working on the to-do items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Explain Changes: At every step, provide a high-level explanation of the changes being made.
6. Keep it Simple: Make every task and code change as simple as humanly possible. Avoid massive or complex changes; touch as little code as possible.
7. Review Changes: Add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any relevant information.
8. Do Not Be Lazy: NEVER BE LAZY. If there is a bug, find the root cause and fix it properly. Do not implement temporary fixes.
9. Simplicity in Fixes: Make all fixes and code changes as simple as humanly possible. They should only impact necessary code relevant to the task and nothing else to avoid introducing new bugs.
